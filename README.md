# CR (Compile and Run)
### A simple tool to determine which compiler to use automatically.


## Introduction
CR is a very simple shell tool which you can add to your ``PATH``. Depending on the file type of the file you are attempting to run, it will automatically select the required compiler for that file type and run the program. If the program does not successfully compile, CR will show you the output from the compiler and skip running the program.
